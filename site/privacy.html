<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>We care about your privacy and do not collect any user data. In order to provide the best possible Nitro experience we collect anonymous analytics so we can measure traffic.</p>
<h2>Information we Collect</h2>
<p>We do not collect any user data but we collect anonymous analytics when Nitro is synced.</p>
<ul>
	<li>OS (e.g. windows)</li>
	<li>Language (e.g english)</li>
	<li>Nitro version (e.g. 1.2)</li>
	<li>Nitro backend (the service you use to store your Nitro information e.g Dropbox, Ubuntu One)</li>
	<li>User ID (e.g. 1235612756)</li>
</ul>
<h2>How we use this information</h2>
<p>
	We collect anonymous analytics so we can measure traffic and provide the best possible experience.
</p>
<p>
	Our Nitro sync server does not store data. Your data is in the hands of the service you choose. Before your data can be synced to the storage backend of your choosing, it needs to go through our server to be merged. Our server prevents creation of &ldquo;conflicted copies&rdquo;. If you wish to run this server yourself, the software is avaliable at <a href="http://github.com/Nitro-Sync">http://github.com/stayradiated/Nitro-Sync</a>
</p>
<h2>Data Security</h2>
<p>
	While we do not store user data, all traffic to our server is encrypted. Authorization between the computer and the storage backend is done securely and we only have access to the information that the Application Programming Interface (API) provides us with.
</p>
<h2>External Services</h2>
<p>Data is stored on the external service of your choice. Please refer to their own privacy policies.</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/terms#privacy">Dropbox</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://one.ubuntu.com/privacy/">Ubuntu One</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Changes to this policy</h2>
<p>
	This Privacy Policy may change from time to time. If we make a change to the privacy policy that we believe materially reduces your rights, we will provide you with notice (for example, by email).
</p>
<h2>How to Contact Us</h2>

<h1>Acceptable use policy</h1>
<p>
Nitro is created by two students. Please don't be mean.
We don't really know what we're doing, Nitro is a project we work on in our spare time.
</p>
<p>
If you find a bug or flaw, please don't try and take down the site with it - contact us so we can get it fixed. We want Nitro Sync to be used for good, not evil.
